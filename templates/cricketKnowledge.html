            <ul>
                <li>Cricket is played between two teams of 11 players each on a field with a 22-yard pitch at the center.</li>
                <li>The game involves three formats: Test cricket (5 days), One Day Internationals (50 overs), and T20 (20 overs per team).</li>
                <li>Each team bats once and bowls once in limited overs formats (ODI & T20).</li>
                <li>The batting team’s objective is to score more runs than the bowling team.</li>
                <li>Each over consists of six balls bowled by a single bowler.</li>
                <li>The objective of the bowler is to dismiss the batsman by getting them out in various ways (e.g., bowled, caught, LBW).</li>
                <li>The batsman aims to defend the stumps and score runs through various shots, such as driving, pulling, and cutting.</li>
                <li>The bowler’s role is to bowl the ball, aiming to get the batsman out while preventing runs.</li>
                <li>The fielding team is spread across the ground to catch the ball and stop the batsmen from scoring runs.</li>
                <li>A run is scored when a batsman hits the ball and runs to the opposite end of the pitch, switching places with the other batsman.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
                <li>Each batsman must wear protective gear such as a helmet, gloves, and pads to avoid injury.</li>
                <li>The batsman’s role is to defend the stumps and hit the ball to score runs.</li>
                <li>The most common ways to get out as a batsman are being bowled, caught, or dismissed LBW (leg before wicket).</li>
                <li>The batsman can score runs by hitting the ball to the boundary or by running between the wickets.</li>
                <li>A boundary is four runs if the ball touches the ground before going over the boundary line, and six runs if it crosses without touching the ground.</li>
                <li>If the batsman is bowled, the wicketkeeper must remove the bails for the dismissal to be complete.</li>
                <li>When facing a bowler, the batsman can decide to leave the ball if it’s outside the off-stump or play a shot to defend the ball.</li>
                <li>The batting team rotates the strike when batsmen change ends after running one or more runs.</li>
                <li>The umpire signals a wide ball if the ball is delivered outside the batsman’s reach and not a legitimate delivery.</li>
                <li>A no-ball is declared if the bowler oversteps the crease or delivers an illegal delivery such as a high bouncer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bowling Knowledge and Rules</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <ul>
                <li>The bowler is allowed to bowl a maximum of six balls in an over.</li>
                <li>In limited-overs formats, bowlers are restricted to a specific number of overs per game (e.g., 10 overs in ODI, 4 overs in T20).</li>
                <li>The bowler must release the ball with their arm straight (no "throwing").</li>
                <li>Different types of deliveries include fast balls, spin balls, bouncers, yorkers, and off-breaks.</li>
                <li>A fast bowler typically aims for pace and accuracy to challenge the batsman’s defenses.</li>
                <li>A spin bowler uses slower deliveries and twists the ball to deceive the batsman.</li>
                <li>The bowler may bowl with different lengths: short-pitched (bouncers), full-pitched (yorkers), or good-length deliveries.</li>
                <li>When a bowler delivers a wide ball or no-ball, the batting side gets an extra delivery and one run is added to the score.</li>
                <li>Some bowlers specialize in taking wickets by deceiving the batsman with variations in speed and flight.</li>
                <li>A bowler can dismiss a batsman in several ways, including bowled, caught, LBW, or stumped (with the wicketkeeper’s help).</li>
            </ul>
